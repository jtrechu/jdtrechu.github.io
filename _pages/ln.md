These are my personal notes and the resources I've used for some of the modules I took during my years at the  
**University of Seville** and the **University of Warwick**.

I am deeply grateful to my professors for their insightful lectures, which have greatly contributed to my understanding of mathematics.  
I hope that fellow undergraduate students in mathematics find these materials helpful in their studies.
