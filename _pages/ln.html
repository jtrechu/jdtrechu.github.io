<h1>Lecture Notes</h1>

<p>
    These are my personal notes and the resources I've used for some of the modules I took during my years at the 
    <strong>University of Seville</strong> and the <strong>University of Warwick</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    I am deeply grateful to my professors for their insightful lectures, which have greatly contributed to my understanding of mathematics.
    I hope that fellow undergraduate students in mathematics find these materials helpful in their studies.
