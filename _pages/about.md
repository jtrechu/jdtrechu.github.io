======

**Welcome!**
I am a mathematics undergraduate student with a strong interest in Probability and Statistics and Operations Research. 

I am in the last semester of a double bachelor’s degree in Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Seville. My fourth year of the program was spent at the University of Warwick. Where I took several Masters' level courses on Probability and Statistics all of which I obtain First Class Honours in. My academic interests extend beyond statistical learning and Operations Research to include percolation theory, random graphs, and other areas of probability and discrete mathematics. I am always eager to explore new ideas and expand my knowledge in these domains.

Currently, I am working on the applications of Operations Research in Statistical Learning. Particularly in regularization for linear regression by developing a novel modification of the **Elastic Net** as part of my Bachelor’s Thesis under the supervision of [Remedios Sillero Denamiel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/m%C2%AA-remedios-sillero-denamiel-954425116/). This project combines my love for theoretical rigor and practical problem-solving, and I am excited to contribute to this evolving field.

This fall, I will be joining the Mathematics MSc program at the University of Bonn, where I look forward to deepening my expertise and collaborating with researchers in my areas of interest. Through this website, I aim to share my research, projects, and insights, as well as connect with others who share a passion for mathematics and its applications. Feel free to explore my work or reach out to discuss ideas—I’d love to hear from you!
